/// purpose. The two facts are learned from one response and are only
/// meaningful together: a row that has the server id but not the photo list
/// looks, to a resumed drain, exactly like a trail with no photos at all --
/// which is how the since-removed `markTrailSynced` came to persist an
/// empty `photos` column and `deleteUnsyncedPhotoDir` came to delete the
/// only copies left on the device. It is nullable, and null means "leave
/// `photos` alone", so a
/// response that carries an id but no usable photo list cannot erase one.
